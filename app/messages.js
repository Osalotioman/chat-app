      I’ve had my fair share of struggles with ML algorithms too. 
      Sometimes it helps to simplify the model first, just to see if it’s a data issue or a logic error. 
      Have you tried breaking it down into smaller pieces and testing each part?

      Good point. I’ve been trying to debug the whole thing at once, but that’s probably why it’s been so frustrating. 
      I’ll start by testing smaller components individually. Thanks for the suggestion!
